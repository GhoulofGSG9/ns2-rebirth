title: Nin's Marine vs Marine
---
Nin's MvM is powered by the Rebirth project, which includes many mods beyond what you see in the MvM-only part of the mod. 
Below are only the changes that affect the Marine vs Marine gameplay.

## Update for Oct 30

* Advanced Shield Generator research now costs 30 resources
* Shield generator now reduces damage from Miniguns

## Update for Oct 28

* Railguns now deal Normal damage (instead of Structural.) This effectively reduces their damage against structures to half that of vanilla.
* Railgun projectile size reduced from 0.3 meters to 0.05 meters.
* New Tech: Advanced Shield Generator. Costs 20 res and takes 120 seconds. It changes the shield generator to give +40 armor and dramatically reduces recharge delay (from 10 seconds to 3 seconds).
* Shield Generator armor fraction is now 95% (advanced and regular versions). Vanilla armor fraction is still 70%.


## All Changes
* Power nodes are neutral, and can only be damaged if your team isn't using it.
* Marines can socket power nodes by walking up and pressing E
* All friendly structures, players, and equipment have a blue outline. Enemies have no outlines.
* All marine to marine damage is increased by 33%
* Marine backwards walk speed increased
* Exosuits takes 25% less damage from all sources, and an additional 50% less damage from bullets
* Railguns now deal Normal damage (instead of Structural) and have a smaller projectile (making it harder to hit players)
* Pulse grenades slow exosuits
* Grenades from the Grenade Launcher lose their ability to explode on impact after bouncing off a surface (prevents spam around corners and skidding along the ground).
* Cluster grenades do 40% extra damage
* Shotguns have a much smaller spread, but deal less damage per pellet
* Nanoshield reduces all damage by 50% (up from 32%)
* Axe damage increased
* ARCs cannot target or damage ARCs, MACs, or power nodes (maps are not designed properly for ARCing power nodes)
* Nerve gas grenades damage armor, just like against aliens. (It's kind of more like an acid grenade)
* Bullets have a slight damage falloff starting at 6 metres (20 feet)
* Flamethrowers cannot ignite marine buildings, but they can ignite marines! Afterburn damage increased slightly. 

## Extra Mods
### Healing field
* Medpacks are replaced by healing fields
* Costs 2 res, lasts for 15 seconds, and can heal up to 300 HP per marine
* Healing fields cannot overlap. If the commander places them too close, the older one will be destroyed.

### New armory GUI and tech
* Shield generator boosts armor utility, giving +10 armor and auto-welding after a short delay. Costs 10 res and 120 seconds to research.
* It also better protects against GL, Miniguns, and Railgun, giving 50% reduction to damage from those sources as long as you have armor.
* Advanced Shield Generator tech changes the shield generator to give +40 armor and reduced recharge delay. Costs 30 res and takes 120 seconds.

### Exosuit boombox 
* Press 1-3 on your keyboard
* can be heard clear across the map

### Hades Device
* Blueprint placed by commander
* Costs 10 res, can only be armed by a marine (not a MAC)
* Detonates after 30 seconds, and does massive damage to all units in a radius (including allies)

### Creepier Atmosphere mod
* Rooms start dark, but flashlights are boosted
* Many other tweaks to visuals, including lens flares, textures, and decals

### Persistent Minimap Buildings
* If you spot an enemy building, it will stay on your minimap until it is destroyed
