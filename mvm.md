title: Nin's Marine vs Marine
---
Nin's MvM is powered by the Rebirth project, which includes many changes beyond what you see in the MvM-only part of the mod. 
Below are only the changes that affect the Marine vs Marine gameplay.

## Update for Nov 14

* Shotgun rebalanced again: damage at a distance has been heavily decreased starting at 2 meters, with damage falling off to only 25% at 15 meters. To compensate, damage has been increased from 8 to 9 damage per pellet. Spread has also been increased very slightly to help do chip damage at medium range.

## Update for Nov 6

* Grenade launcher change reverted to vanilla NS2. You can now skid grenade launcher shots along the ground and they will explode on impact. Note that the minimum arming time from vanilla NS2 is still enabled.
* Shotgun damage increased slightly so you should be able to one-shot a marine with no upgrades when you have no upgrades from close range. 
* Shield generator research cost reduced from 10/20/30 to 10/15/20. 
* Shield generator research time reduced from 90/120/120 to 45/45/45. 

## All Changes
* Power nodes are neutral, and can only be damaged if your team isn't using it.
* Marines can socket power nodes by walking up and pressing E
* All friendly structures, players, and equipment have a blue outline. Enemies have no outlines.
* All marine to marine damage is increased by 33%
* Marine backwards walk speed increased
* Exosuits takes 25% less damage from all sources, and an additional 50% less damage from bullets
* Railguns now deal Normal damage (instead of Structural) and have a smaller projectile (making it harder to hit players)
* Pulse grenades slow exosuits
* Cluster grenades do 40% extra damage
* Shotguns have a much smaller spread, but deal less damage per pellet. Their bullets also drop in damage very quickly.
* Nanoshield reduces all damage by 50% (up from 32%)
* Axe damage increased
* ARCs cannot target or damage ARCs, MACs, or power nodes (maps are not designed properly for ARCing power nodes)
* Nerve gas grenades damage armor, just like against aliens. (It's kind of more like an acid grenade)
* Bullets have a slight damage falloff starting at 6 metres (20 feet)
* Flamethrowers cannot ignite marine buildings, but they can ignite marines! Afterburn damage increased slightly. 

## Extra Mods
### Healing field
* Medpacks are replaced by healing fields
* Costs 2 res, lasts for 15 seconds, and can heal up to 300 HP per marine
* Healing fields cannot overlap. If the commander places them too close, the older one will be destroyed.

### New armory GUI and tech
* Shield generator boosts armor utility, giving +10 armor and auto-welding after a 10 second delay. Costs 10 res and 45 seconds to research.
* It also better protects against GL, Miniguns, and Railgun, giving 50% reduction to damage from those sources as long as you have armor.
* Shield generator can be upgraded to provide +10 armor per level (max +30), and can have the regeneration delay reduced to 5 and then 3 seconds at max level

### Exosuit boombox 
* Press 1-3 on your keyboard
* can be heard clear across the map

### Hades Device
* Blueprint placed by commander
* Costs 10 res, can only be armed by a marine (not a MAC)
* Detonates after 25 seconds, and does massive damage to all units in a radius (including allies)

### Creepier Atmosphere mod
* Rooms start dark, but flashlights are boosted
* Many other tweaks to visuals, including lens flares, textures, and decals

### Persistent Minimap Buildings
* If you spot an enemy building, it will stay on your minimap until it is destroyed

### Machine Gun Rebalance
* Machine guns now reloads twice as fast, but firing it lowers your move speed by 20%. All other values remain the same as vanilla.
