title: Nin's Marine vs Marine
---
Nin's MvM is powered by the Rebirth project, which includes many changes beyond what you see in the MvM-only part of the mod. 
Below are only the changes that affect the Marine vs Marine gameplay.

## Update for Dec 19

* Yet again, shotgun has been changed. Now an even tighter spread and increased damage, but faster damage falloff. It'll be useful and fun someday, I swear!

## Update for Dec 6

* Shotgun has been rebalanced from 17 pellets down to 9. The damage each pellet does has been scaled so the total damage remains the same. 
* Shotgun damage falloff minimum distance has been increased slightly.

## Update for Nov 29

* Power nodes now always show their status on the minimap (unbuilt, building, under attack)
* Railgun projectile width changed to 50% of vanilla (changed to 0.15 from  0.3)

## Update for Nov 23

* Grenade Launcher blast radius reduced by 25% from 4.8 meters to 3.6 meters

## Update for Nov 19

* Marine jetpack fuel use no longer depends on your inventory weight. Instead, jetpack acceleration is scaled to your inventory weight

## Update for Nov 16

* Sentries no longer require a Sentry Battery. They are still limited to 3 per room and they still require a Robotics Factory to be constructed.
* Sentries will now prioritize shooting players over nearby structures

## All Changes
* Power nodes are neutral, and can only be damaged if your team isn't using it.
* Marines can socket power nodes by walking up and pressing E
* All friendly structures, players, and equipment have a blue outline. Enemies have no outlines.
* All marine to marine damage is increased by 33%
* Marine backwards walk speed increased
* Exosuits takes 25% less damage from all sources, and an additional 50% less damage from bullets
* Railguns now deal Normal damage (instead of Structural) and have a smaller projectile (making it harder to hit players)
* Pulse grenades slow exosuits
* Cluster grenades do 40% extra damage
* Shotguns have a much smaller spread, but deal less damage per pellet. Their bullets also drop in damage very quickly.
* Nanoshield reduces all damage by 50% (up from 32%)
* Axe damage increased
* ARCs cannot target or damage ARCs, MACs, or power nodes (maps are not designed properly for ARCing power nodes)
* Nerve gas grenades damage armor, just like against aliens. (It's kind of more like an acid grenade)
* Bullets have a slight damage falloff starting at 6 metres (20 feet)
* Flamethrowers cannot ignite marine buildings, but they can ignite marines! Afterburn damage increased slightly. 
* Grenade Launcher blast radius reduced by 25% from 4.8 meters to 3.6 meters
* Marine jetpack fuel use no longer depends on your inventory weight. Instead, jetpack acceleration is scaled to your inventory weight

## Extra Mods
### Healing field
* Medpacks are replaced by healing fields
* Costs 2 res, lasts for 15 seconds, and can heal up to 300 HP per marine
* Healing fields cannot overlap. If the commander places them too close, the older one will be destroyed.

### New armory GUI and tech
* Shield generator boosts armor utility, giving +10 armor and auto-welding after a 10 second delay. Costs 10 res and 45 seconds to research.
* It also better protects against GL, Miniguns, and Railgun, giving 50% reduction to damage from those sources as long as you have armor.
* Shield generator can be upgraded to provide +10 armor per level (max +30), and can have the regeneration delay reduced to 5 and then 3 seconds at max level

### Exosuit boombox 
* Press 1-3 on your keyboard
* can be heard clear across the map

### Hades Device
* Blueprint placed by commander
* Costs 10 res, can only be armed by a marine (not a MAC)
* Detonates after 25 seconds, and does massive damage to all units in a radius (including allies)

### Creepier Atmosphere mod
* Rooms start dark, but flashlights are boosted
* Many other tweaks to visuals, including lens flares, textures, and decals

### Persistent Minimap Buildings
* If you spot an enemy building, it will stay on your minimap until it is destroyed

### Machine Gun Rebalance
* Machine guns now reloads twice as fast, but firing it lowers your move speed by 20%. All other values remain the same as vanilla.
