# ns2-rebirth

A gameplay and interface overhaul designed to lower the skill floor, while making the game more diverse and more interesting.

Although they all work on their own, you are reccomended to run all at once. They all are tested together and against a number of other mods, including NS2+ and shine.

If you wish to use all the mods together, use the NS2:Rebirth collection mod: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=883591916
